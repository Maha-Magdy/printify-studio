# Printify Studio

## About

Printify Studio is a web-based application that allows users to upload or drag and drop photos, then make a variety of adjustments to them before printing. Developed using plain CSS and JavaScript, this app is easy to use and offers a wide range of customization options.

_PS: After being inspired by Wes Bos' JAVASCRIPT30 course, I decided to follow it and build the Tick Tock Tech Clock application to keep my hands dirty with JavaScript._
